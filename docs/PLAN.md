# RouteWise — Development Plan

Living document. Claude reads it before starting work and updates
checkboxes when a milestone is completed.

## Scope (v1)
- Create, view, edit and delete saved trips
- Compare transport modes for a trip by time, cost and CO₂
- Weather-aware recommendation for the departure date
- AI travel advisor: free-text trip request → trip draft + explanation
- Works with zero configuration (rule-based fallback without an AI key)

Out of scope for v1: authentication, real-time timetables, booking.

## Domain model

**City**: seeded reference data
`id, name, country, latitude, longitude`

**TransportMode**: seeded reference data
`code (TRAIN|BUS|CAR|BIKE|PLANE), avgSpeedKmh, costPerKm, co2GramsPerKm, fixedOverheadMinutes, maxDistanceKm`

**Trip**: user-owned, full CRUD
`id, title, originCityId, destinationCityId, departureDate, travelers, priority (FASTEST|CHEAPEST|GREENEST|BALANCED), notes, createdAt, updatedAt`

**Comparison**: computed, not stored
Per mode: `durationMinutes, totalCost, co2Kg, score, recommended`.
Distance = haversine between cities × road/rail factor.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/trips` | List trips |
| GET | `/api/trips/{id}` | Trip details |
| POST | `/api/trips` | Create trip (201 + Location) |
| PUT | `/api/trips/{id}` | Update trip |
| DELETE | `/api/trips/{id}` | Delete trip (204) |
| GET | `/api/trips/{id}/comparison` | Mode comparison + recommendation |
| GET | `/api/trips/{id}/advice` | AI/rule-based advice incl. weather |
| POST | `/api/advisor/parse` | Free text → trip draft |
| GET | `/api/cities` | Cities for autocomplete |
| GET | `/api/transport-modes` | Mode parameters |

## External services
- **Open-Meteo**: weather forecast, no API key required
- **LLM provider**: optional, via env variable; behind an `AdvisorClient`
  interface with a rule-based implementation as fallback

## Milestones

- [ ] `feat/frontend-trips`: trip list, form, details, delete
- [ ] `feat/frontend-comparison`: comparison view, advice panel, free-text input
- [ ] `docs/readme-demo`: README, screenshots, demo recording

## Decisions log
| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-10 | H2 in-memory + Flyway | Zero-setup run; schema still versioned like production |
| 2026-11-10 | Comparison computed, not stored | Always reflects current mode parameters; less state |
| 2026-11-10 | Open-Meteo for weather | Free, no key, keeps zero-config promise |
| 2026-11-11 | Root + module CLAUDE.md files | Module rules load only when relevant |
| 2026-11-11 | Spring Boot 4.1.2 + springdoc-openapi 3.2.0 | Latest stable Boot; springdoc 3.x is the line built for Boot 4 |
| 2026-11-11 | `GlobalExceptionHandler` extends `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` | Spring MVC's own errors (malformed JSON, 405, 415, unknown path) also return Problem Details |
| 2026-11-11 | CORS origins via `routewise.cors.allowed-origins` (env `ROUTEWISE_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) | Default works locally with zero config; deployable origins without code changes |
| 2026-11-11 | Trip responses embed `origin`/`destination` as `{id, name, country}`; requests send `originCityId`/`destinationCityId` | UI shows city names without extra lookups; writes stay id-based |
| 2026-11-11 | 25 seeded European cities; travelers 1–9 | Distances where every mode is plausible; typical group-booking limit |
| 2026-11-11 | Unknown city id or origin = destination → 400 with `errors` entry (`FieldValidationException`) | It is invalid input, not a missing resource; same shape as Bean Validation errors |
| 2026-11-11 | Transport mode cost/CO₂ are per traveler, except CAR (per vehicle) | Matches how fares vs. car costs work; comparison engine divides CAR by travelers |
| 2026-11-11 | Departure date must be today or later on create; on update a past date may be kept unchanged | Past trips stay editable (title, notes) without allowing new past dates |
| 2026-11-11 | H2 pinned to 2.3.232 | 2.4.240 breaks CHECK constraints created on another connection (Flyway); revisit on next H2 release |
| 2026-11-11 | API default port 8087 (`SERVER_PORT` overrides) | 8080 collides with common local services; zero-config start must just work |
| 2026-11-11 | Route distance = haversine × 1.2 (train), 1.3 (road: bus, car, bike), 1.0 (plane) | Simple, explainable detour factors; good enough without routing APIs |
| 2026-11-11 | Score 0–100: min-max normalised time/cost/CO₂ among available modes, weighted 0.6/0.2/0.2 by priority (BALANCED ⅓ each) | Relative ranking per trip; priority clearly dominates |
| 2026-11-11 | Car: 5 seats per car; cost and CO₂ per vehicle | 6–9 travelers need 2 cars |
| 2026-11-11 | Weather adjusts scores: bike ×0.4 for rain/snow/thunderstorm/wind ≥ 40 km/h/max < 3 °C; car and bus ×0.9 for snow/ice; worst of origin and destination counts | Weather-aware recommendation with a visible note per affected mode |
| 2026-11-11 | Weather is best-effort: outside today…+15 days, on errors or timeouts (2 s connect / 3 s read) the comparison is returned without weather | Zero-config and no hard dependency on an external service |
| 2026-11-11 | Added `spring-boot-starter-restclient` | Boot 4 moved `RestClient.Builder` auto-configuration into this module |
